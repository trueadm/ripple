Ripple uses a JSX-like syntax for its templates. This means that if you know React, Preact, or similar libraries, you'll feel right at home.

Define reusable components with the `component` keyword. These are similar to functions in that they have `props`, but crucially, they allow for a JSX-like syntax to be defined alongside standard TypeScript. That means you do not _return JSX_ like in other frameworks, but you instead use it like a JavaScript statement, as shown:

```ripple
component Button(props: { text: string, onClick: () => void }) {
  <button onClick={props.onClick}>
    {props.text}
  </button>
}

// Usage
component App() {
  <Button text="Click me" onClick={() => console.log("Clicked!")} />
}
```

Ripple's templating language also supports shorthands and object spreads too:

```svelte
// you can do a normal prop
<div onClick={onClick}>{text}</div>

// or using the shorthand prop
<div {onClick}>{text}</div>

// and you can spread props
<div {...properties}>{text}</div>
```
