Like React, events are props that start with `on` and then continue with an uppercase character, such as:

- `onClick`
- `onPointerMove`
- `onPointerDown`
- `onKeyDown`

For `capture` phase events, just add `Capture` to the end of the prop name:

- `onClickCapture`
- `onPointerMoveCapture`
- `onPointerDownCapture`
- `onKeyDownCapture`

> Note: Some events are automatically delegated where possible by Ripple to improve runtime performance.
