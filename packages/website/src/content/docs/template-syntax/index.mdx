## Templating

Ripple's templating language is JSX-like, but it has some key differences to make it more ergonomic and easier to use. Templating in Ripple can only occur _inside_ a `component` body â€“ you can't create JSX inside functions, or assign it to variables as an expression.


```ripple
<div>
  // you can create variables inside the template!
  const str = "hello world";

  console.log(str); // and function calls too!

  debugger; // you can put breakpoints anywhere to help debugging!

  {str}
</div>
```

Note that strings inside the template need to be inside `{"string"}`, you can't do `<div>hello</div>` as Ripple
has no idea if `hello` is a string or maybe some JavaScript code that needs evaluating, so just ensure you wrap them
in curly braces. This shouldn't be an issue in the real-world anyway, as you'll likely use an i18n library that means
using JavaScript expressions regardless.
