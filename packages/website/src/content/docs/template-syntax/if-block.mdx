If blocks work seemlessly with Ripple's templating language, you can put them inside the JSX-like
statements, making control-flow far easier to read and reason with.

```ripple
component Truthy({ x }) {
  <div>
    if (x) {
      <span>
        {"x is truthy"}
      </span>
    } else {
      <span>
        {"x is falsy"}
      </span>
    }
  </div>
}
```
