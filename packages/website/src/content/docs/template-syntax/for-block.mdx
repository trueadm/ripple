description: Learn how to loop over collections with for blocks in Ripple

You can render collections using a `for...of` block, and you don't need to specify a `key` prop like
other frameworks.

```ripple
component ListView({ title, items }) {
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <ul>
    for (const item of items) {
      <li>{item.text}</li>
    }
  </ul>
}
```
