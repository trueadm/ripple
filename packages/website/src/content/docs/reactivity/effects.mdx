### Effects

When dealing with reactive state, you might want to be able to create side-effects based upon changes that happen upon updates.
To do this, you can use `effect`:

```ripple
import { effect } from 'ripple';

component App() {
  let $count = 0;

  effect(() => {
    console.log($count);
  });

  <button onClick={() => $count++}>Increment</button>
}
```
