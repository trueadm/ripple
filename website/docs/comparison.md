# Comparison to other frameworks

## vs React
- No JSX functions/returns - components use statement-based templates
- Built-in reactivity with `track` and `@` syntax instead of useState/useEffect
- Scoped CSS without CSS-in-JS libraries
- No virtual DOM - fine-grained reactivity

## vs Svelte
- TypeScript-first approach
- JSX-like syntax instead of HTML templates
- Similar reactivity concepts but different syntax

## vs Solid
- Component definition with `component` keyword
- Built-in collections (RippleArray, RippleSet)
- Different templating approach within component bodies
