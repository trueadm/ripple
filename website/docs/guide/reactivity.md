# Reactivity

## Reactive Variables

You use `track` to create a single tracked value. The `track` function will created a `Tracked<T>` object that
is not accessible from the outside, and instead you must use `@` to read or write to the tracked value. You can pass the `Tracked<T>` object between components, functions and context
to read and write to the value in different parts of your codebase.

```ts
import { track } from 'ripple';

let name = track('World');
let count = track(0);

// Updates automatically trigger re-renders
@count++;
```

Objects can also contain tracked values with `@` to access the reactive object property:

```ts
import { track } from 'ripple';

let counter = { current: track(0) };

// Updates automatically trigger re-renders
counter.@current++;
```

Tracked derived values are also `Tracked<T>` objects, except you pass a function to `track` rather than a value:

```ts
let count = track(0);
let double = track(() => @count * 2);
let quadruple = track(() => @double * 2);

console.log(@quadruple);
```

If you want to use a tracked value inside a reactive context, such as an effect but you don't want that value to be a tracked dependency, you can use `untrack`:

```ts
let count = track(0);
let double = track(() => @count * 2);
let quadruple = track(() => @double * 2);

effect(() => {
  // This effect will never fire again, as we've untracked the only dependency it has
  console.log(untrack(() => @quadruple));
})
```

::: info Note
You cannot create `Tracked` objects in module/global scope, they have to be created on access from an active component context.
:::

### track with get / set

The optional get and set parameters of the `track` function let you customize how a tracked value is read or written, similar to property accessors but expressed as pure functions. The get function receives the current stored value and its return value is exposed when the tracked value is accessed / unboxed with `@`. The set function should return the value that will actually be stored and receives two parameters: the first is the one being assigned and the second with the previous value. The get and set functions may be useful for tasks such as logging, validating, or transforming values before they are exposed or stored.

```ripple
import { track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  let count = track(0,
    (current) => {
      console.log(current);
      return current;
    },
    (next, prev) => {
      console.log(prev);
      if (typeof next === 'string') {
        next = Number(next);
      }

      return next;
    }
  );
}
```

::: info Note
If no value is returned from either `get` or `set`, `undefined` is either exposed (for get) or stored (for set). Also, if only supplying the `set`, the `get` parameter must be set to `undefined`.
:::

#### trackSplit Function

The `trackSplit` "splits" a plain object — such as component props — into specified tracked variables and an extra `rest` property containing the remaining unspecified object properties.

```ripple
const [children, count, rest] = trackSplit(props, ['children', 'count']);
```

When working with component props, destructuring is often useful — both for direct use as variables and for collecting remaining properties into a `rest` object (which can be named arbitrarily). If destructuring happens in the component argument, e.g. `component Child({ children, value, ...rest })`, Ripple automatically links variable access to the original props — for example, `value` is compiled to `props.value`, preserving reactivity. However, destructuring inside the component body, e.g. `const { children, value, ...rest } = props`, does not preserve reactivity due to various edge cases. To ensure destructured variables remain reactive in this case, use the `trackSplit` function.

A full example utilizing various Ripple constructs demonstrates the `split` option usage:

<Code console>

```ripple
import { track, trackSplit } from 'ripple';
import type { PropsWithChildren, Tracked } from 'ripple';

component Child(props: PropsWithChildren<{ count: Tracked<number> }>) {
  const [children, count, className, rest] = trackSplit(props, ['children', 'count', 'class']);

  <button class={@className} {...@rest}><@children /></button>
  <pre>{`Count is: ${@count}`}</pre>
  <button onClick={() => @count++}>{'Increment Count'}</button>
}

export component App() {
    let count = track(0,
    (current) => {
      console.log('getter', current);
      return current;
    },
    (next) => {
      console.log('setter', next);
      return next;
    }
  );
  let className = track('shadow');
  let name = track('Click Me');

  function buttonRef(el) {
    console.log('ref called with', el);
    return () => {
      console.log('cleanup ref for', el);
    };
  }

  <Child
    class={@className}
    onClick={() => { @name === 'Click Me' ? @name = 'Clicked' : @name = 'Click Me'; @className = ''}}
    count={count}
    {ref buttonRef}
  >{@name}</Child>;
}
```

</Code>

With the regular destructuring, such as the one below, the `count` and `class` properties would lose their reactivity:

```ripple
// ❌ WRONG Reactivity would be lost
let { children, count, class: className, ...rest } = props;
```

::: info Note
Make sure the resulting `rest`, if it's going to be spread onto a dom element, does not contain `Tracked` values. Otherwise, you'd be spreading not the actual values but the boxed ones, which are objects that will appear as `[Object object]` on the dom element.
:::

## Transporting Reactivity

Ripple doesn't constrain reactivity to components only. `Tracked<T>` objects can simply be passed by reference between boundaries:

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track } from 'ripple';

function createDouble([ count ]) {
  const double = track(() => @count * 2);

  effect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', @count)
  });

  return [ double ];
}

export component App() {
  let count = track(0);

  const [ double ] = createDouble([ count ]);

  <div>{'Double: ' + @double}</div>
  <button onClick={() => { @count++; }}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

</Code>

You can do the same with objects too:

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track } from 'ripple';

function createDouble({ count }) {
  const double = track(() => @count * 2);

  effect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', @count)
  });

  return { double };
}

export component App() {
  let count = track(0);
  const { double } = createDouble({ count });

  <div>{'Double: ' + @double}</div>
  <button onClick={() => { @count++; }}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

</Code>

## Dynamic Components

Ripple has built-in support for dynamic components, a way to render different components based on reactive state. Instead of hardcoding which component to show, you can store a component in a `Tracked` via `track()`, and update it at runtime. When the tracked value changes, Ripple automatically unmounts the previous component and mounts the new one. Dynamic components are written with the `<@Component />` tag, where the @ both unwraps the tracked reference and tells the compiler that the component is dynamic. This makes it straightforward to pass components as props or swap them directly within a component, enabling flexible, state-driven UIs with minimal boilerplate.

<Code>

```ripple
import { track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  let swapMe = track(() => Child1);

  <Child {swapMe} />

  <button onClick={() => @swapMe = @swapMe === Child1 ? Child2 : Child1}>
		{'Swap Component'}
	</button>
}

component Child({ swapMe }: {swapMe: Tracked<Component>}) {
  <@swapMe />
}

component Child1(props) {
  <pre>{'I am child 1'}</pre>
}

component Child2(props) {
  <pre>{'I am child 2'}</pre>
}
```

</Code>

## Array Transport Pattern

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track } from 'ripple';

function createDouble([ count ]) {
  const double = track(() => @count * 2);

  effect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', @count)
  });

  return [ double ];
}

export component App() {
  let count = track(0);

  const [ double ] = createDouble([ count ]);

  <div>{'Double: ' + @double}</div>
  <button onClick={() => { @count++; }}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

</Code>

## Object Transport Pattern

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track } from 'ripple';

function createDouble({ count }) {
  const double = track(() => @count * 2);

  effect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', @count)
  });
  return { double };
}

export component App() {
  let count = track(0);
  const { double } = createDouble({ count });

  <div>{'Double: ' + @double}</div>
  <button onClick={() => { @count++; }}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

</Code>

## Component Transport Pattern

<Code console>

```ripple
import { track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  const tracked_basic = track(() => basic);
  const obj = {
    tracked_basic,
  };
  const tracked_object = track(obj);
  const Button = track(() => SomeButton);
  const AnotherButton = track(() => SomeButton);

  <@tracked_object.@tracked_basic />
  <Child {Button}>{'Child Button'}</Child>
  <AnotherChild Button={AnotherButton}>{'Another Child Button'}</AnotherChild>
}

component Child({ Button, children }) {
  <@Button><children /></@Button>
}

component AnotherChild(props) {
  <props.@Button><props.children /></props.@Button>
}

component SomeButton({ children }) {
  <button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')}>
		<children />
	</button>
}

component basic() {
  <div>{'Basic Component'}</div>
}
```

</Code>

**Transport Rules:**

- Reactive state must be connected to a component
- Cannot be global or created at module/global scope
- Use arrays `[ trackedVar ]` or objects `{ trackedVar }` to transport reactivity
- Functions can accept and return reactive state using these patterns
- This enables composable reactive logic outside of component boundaries

## Effects

When dealing with reactive state, you might want to be able to create side-effects based upon changes that happen upon updates.
To do this, you can use `effect`:

<Code console>

```ripple
import { track, effect } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  let count = track(0);

  effect(() => {
    console.log(@count);
  });

  <button onClick={() => @count++}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

</Code>

## Untracking Reactivity

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track, untrack } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  let count = track(10);
  let double = track(() => @count * 2);
  let quadruple = track(() => @double * 2);

  effect(() => {
    // This effect will never fire again, as we've untracked the only dependency it has
    console.log(untrack(() => @quadruple));
  })
}
```

</Code>

## Reactive Collection Primitives <Badge type="warning" text="Experimental" />

Because Ripple isn't based on Signals, there is no mechanism with which we can
hijack collection mutations. Thus, you'll need to use the reactive collection
primitives that Ripple offers for reactivity for an entire collection.

#### Simple Reactive Array

Just like objects, you can use the `Tracked<T>` objects in any standard JavaScript object, like arrays:

<Code console>

```ripple
import { effect, track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
	let first = track(1);
	let second = track(2);
	const arr = [first, second];

	const total = track(() => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + @b, 0));

	effect(() => {
		console.log(@total);
	})
}
```

</Code>

Like shown in the above example, you can compose normal arrays with reactivity and pass them through props or boundaries.

However, if you need the entire array to be fully reactive, including when new elements get added, you should use the reactive array that Ripple provides.

#### Fully Reactive Array

`TrackedArray` class from Ripple extends the standard JS `Array` class, and supports all of its methods and properties. Import it from the `'ripple'` namespace or use the provided syntactic sugar for a quick creation via the bracketed notation. All elements existing or new of the `TrackedArray` are reactive and respond to the various array operations such as push, pop, shift, unshift, etc. Even if you reference a non-existent element, once it added, the original reference will react to the change. You do NOT need to use the unboxing `@` with the elements of the array.

```ripple
import { TrackedArray } from 'ripple';

// using syntactic sugar `#`
const arr = #[1, 2, 3];

// using the new constructor
const arr = new TrackedArray(1, 2, 3);

// using static from method
const arr = TrackedArray.from([1, 2, 3]);

// using static of method
const arr = TrackedArray.of(1, 2, 3);
```

Usage Example:

```ripple
export component App() {
  const items = #[1, 2, 3];

  <div>
    <p>{"Length: "}{items.length}</p>  // Reactive length
    for (const item of items) {
      <div>{item}</div>
    }
    <button onClick={() => items.push(items.length + 1)}>{"Add"}</button>
  </div>
}
```

#### Reactive Object

`TrackedObject` class extends the standard JS `Object` class, and supports all of its methods and properties. Import it from the `'ripple'` namespace or use the provided syntactic sugar for a quick creation via the curly brace notation. `TrackedObject` fully supports shallow reactivity and any property on the root level is reactive. You can even reference non-existent properties and once added the original reference reacts to the change. You do NOT need to use the unboxing `@` with the properties of the `TrackedObject`.

```ripple
import { TrackedObject } from 'ripple';

// using syntactic sugar `#`
const arr = #{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

// using the new constructor
const arr = new TrackedObject({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3});
```

Usage Example:

```ripple
export component App() {
  const obj = #{a: 0}

  obj.a = 0;

  <pre>{'obj.a is: '}{obj.a}</pre>
  <pre>{'obj.b is: '}{obj.b}</pre>
  <button onClick={() => { obj.a++; obj.b = obj.b ?? 5; obj.b++; }}>{'Increment'}</button>
}
```

#### Reactive Set

The `TrackedSet` extends the standard JS `Set` class, and supports all of its methods and properties.

```ripple
import { TrackedSet } from 'ripple';

const set = new TrackedSet([1, 2, 3]);
```

TrackedSet's reactive methods or properties can be used directly or assigned to reactive variables.

<Code>

```ripple
import { TrackedSet, track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  const set = new TrackedSet([1, 2, 3]);

  // direct usage
  <p>{"Direct usage: set contains 2: "}{set.has(2)}</p>

  // reactive assignment
  let has = track(() => set.has(2));
  <p>{"Assigned usage: set contains 2: "}{@has}</p>

  <button onClick={() => set.delete(2)}>{"Delete 2"}</button>
  <button onClick={() => set.add(2)}>{"Add 2"}</button>
}
```

</Code>

#### Reactive Map

The `TrackedMap` extends the standard JS `Map` class, and supports all of its methods and properties.

```ripple
import { TrackedMap, track } from 'ripple';

const map = new TrackedMap([[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]]);
```

TrackedMap's reactive methods or properties can be used directly or assigned to reactive variables.

<Code>

```ripple
import { TrackedMap, track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  const map = new TrackedMap([[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]]);

  // direct usage
  <p>{"Direct usage: map has an item with key 2: "}{map.has(2)}</p>

  // reactive assignment
  let has = track(() => map.has(2));
  <p>{"Assigned usage: map has an item with key 2: "}{@has}</p>

  <button onClick={() => map.delete(2)}>{"Delete item with key 2"}</button>
  <button onClick={() => map.set(2, 2)}>{"Add key 2 with value 2"}</button>
}
```

</Code>

#### Reactive Date

The `TrackedDate` extends the standard JS `Date` class, and supports all of its methods and properties.

```ripple
import { TrackedDate } from 'ripple';

const date = new TrackedDate(2026, 0, 1); // January 1, 2026
```

TrackedDate's reactive methods or properties can be used directly or assigned to reactive variables. All getter methods (`getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`, etc.) and formatting methods (`toISOString()`, `toDateString()`, etc.) are reactive and will update when the date is modified.

<Code>

```ripple
import { TrackedDate, track } from 'ripple';

export component App() {
  const date = new TrackedDate(2025, 0, 1, 12, 0, 0);

  // direct usage
  <p>{"Direct usage: Current year is "}{date.getFullYear()}</p>
  <p>{"ISO String: "}{date.toISOString()}</p>

  // reactive assignment
  let year = track(() => date.getFullYear());
  let month = track(() => date.getMonth());
  <p>{"Assigned usage: Year "}{@year}{", Month "}{@month}</p>

  <button onClick={() => date.setFullYear(2027)}>{"Change to 2026"}</button>
  <button onClick={() => date.setMonth(11)}>{"Change to December"}</button>
}
```

</Code>
