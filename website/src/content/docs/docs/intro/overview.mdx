## What is Ripple?

Ripple is a TypeScript UI framework for the web written by Dominic Gannaway ([@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm))

```ripple
export component App() {
  <div class="container">
    <h1>{"Welcome to Ripple!"}</h1>

    <div>
      let $count = 0;

      <button onClick={() => $count--}>{"-"}</button>
      <span class="count">{$count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => $count++}>{"+"}</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <style>
    .container {
      text-align: center;
      font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
    }
  </style>
}
```

Ripple was designed to be a JS/TS-first framework, rather than HTML-first. Ripple modules have their own `.ripple` extension and these modules fully support TypeScript. By introducing a new extension, it affords Ripple to invent its own superset language, that plays really nicely with TypeScript and JSX, but with a few interesting touches.

Ripple uses internally a compiler to convert `.ripple` files into standard JavaScript and HTML that can be run in any modern browser.

## Features

- Reactive State Management: Built-in reactivity with `$` prefixed variables
- Component-Based Architecture: Clean, reusable components with props and children
- JSX-like Syntax: Familiar templating with Ripple-specific enhancements
- TypeScript Support: Full TypeScript integration with type checking
- VSCode Integration: Rich editor support with diagnostics, syntax highlighting, and IntelliSense

  Ripple is still in early development, and should not be used in production.
