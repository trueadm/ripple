You can clone the basic template to experiment with Ripple

```bash
npx degit trueadm/ripple/templates/basic ripple-demo

cd ripple-demo
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Editor setup

Ripple maintains a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ripplejs.ripple-vscode-plugin) providing syntax highlighting for `.ripple` files, real-time diagnostics for compilation errors, typescript integration for type checking and intelliSense for autocompletion.
